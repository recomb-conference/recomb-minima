## Overview

The RECOMB conference series, founded in 1997, provides a scientific forum for communicating advances in computational biology and applications in molecular biology and medicine. The conference aims to bridge the computational, mathematical, statistical, and biological sciences, and bringing together researchers, professionals, students and industrial practitioners from all over the world for interaction and exchange of new developments in all areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. The conference will feature keynote talks by leading scientists, presentations of peer-reviewed high-quality research papers, presentations of exciting research developments that were published within the past year and poster sessions on latest research progress.

## Topics

Papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and applied) in all areas of computational molecular biology are suitable for submission. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Algorithms & Theory for Computational Biology
- Biological sequence algorithms
- Sequencing and genotyping technologies
- Metagenomics and microbiome analysis
- Regulatory genomics
- Transcriptomics
- Single-cell and spatial omics
- Protein structure and function
- Computational proteomics and proteogenomics
- Computational structural biology
- Population genetics and statistical genomics
- Evolution and comparative genomics
- Multimodal and imaging-based machine learning for biology
- Gene regulation and epigenomics
- Structure and function of non-coding RNAs
- Computational metabolomics
- Computational systems and network biology
- Data privacy and security in biomedical research

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions should represent original, previously unpublished work. The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted papers. Selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Please use the following submission link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2026).

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.

Authors **must post their submission on a preprint server like bioRxiv**. They should not assume that a formal proceedings volume will be published, as a final decision is still pending. All accepted papers will have opportunities for publication through our journal partners.

### Key Dates

- **Abstract submission deadline**: 7 November 2025, 23:59 AoE
- **Full paper submission deadline**: 14 November 2025, 23:59 AoE (updates to registered abstracts only)
- **Author notification**: 12 January 2026
- **Final version due**: 25 February 2026
- **Conference dates**: 26-29 May 2026

### Formatting instructions for paper submission

- **Main paper format**: All paper submissions must be in PDF format. The maximum length is **10 pages (Letter or A4 format)**, including all figures/tables and their captions, using **a minimum font size of 10pt and 1-inch margins**. An additional title page containing the paper title, author list, and abstract is permitted. The bibliography does not count toward the page limit. Submissions that violate the formatting requirement (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or exceed the page limit may be rejected without review. There is no specific template requirement beyond these guidelines. Authors may choose to use the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science template available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WtR5Hy5ua71), as long at the above-mentioned page limit and margin requirements are respected.

- **Optional Appendix**: If necessary, an Appendix can be submitted as Supplementary Material in a single PDF file. The Appendix should contain materials directly supporting the paper content. There is no page limit for the Appendix, but please note that reviewing the Appendix is at the discretion of the reviewers.

- **Source code availability**: Importantly, if the paper involves the development of new software or analysis methods, the source code must be made publicly accessible via e.g. a GitHub repository, with a README file that is sufficiently documented by the submission deadline for reviewers to examine. A minimal test dataset must be provided so that the software can be tested on a small example. The link to the public repository must be clearly indicated in the paper.

### Abstract registration

There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline on **7 November 2025 23:59 AoE**, seven days prior to the full paper submissions deadline. This deadline allows the Program Committee to begin planning review assignments ahead of full paper submissions. After the abstract submission deadline has passed, new submissions will not be accepted, but authors can update the full paper submission before the paper submission deadline on **14 November 2025 23:59 AoE**. Please ensure the abstract registration closely aligns with full paper submission in terms of title, author list, and abstract content. "Placeholder" abstract registrations without meaningful descriptions will not be accepted. While minor updates to the abstract are allowed before the full paper submission deadline, any substantial changes to the title or abstract content risk being removed without consideration.

### Journal publication

RECOMB is partnering with **Cell Systems, Genome Research**, and the **Journal of Computational Biology**. Authors of selected accepted papers will be invited, but not required, to submit a revised version of their paper for a special issue in one of the partnering journals. These journals will require some expansion of the RECOMB accepted papers. Preprint server submissions are allowed without restrictions. Submissions to peer-reviewed journals other than the partnering ones are also allowed, after the authors have received a decision on their initial submission, whether accepted or rejected.

Authors will be notified of whether their paper is accepted for oral presentation at RECOMB and simultaneously whether it is being further considered for expedited review by Cell Systems or Genome Research upon RECOMB acceptance notification. In addition to the RECOMB reviewers, the editors of Cell Systems and Genome Research, as well as potentially 1-2 additional reviewers with particular knowledge of the biological applications addressed, will be actively engaged in those accepted RECOMB papers being considered for Cell Systems and Genome Research, respectively.

Separately, all accepted papers not published elsewhere will be offered publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology.


### Contact

All questions about submissions should be emailed to the [Program Committee Chair](mailto:rayan.chikhi@pasteur.fr).

*Information about highlights and poster submissions will be shared at a later date*.
